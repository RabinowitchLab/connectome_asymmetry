# connectome_asymmetry
All the code, raw data, input files and stored networks used to generate the results in "Asymmetry in synaptic connectivity balances redundancy and reachability in the _C. elegans_ connectome".

_birari_rabinowitch_asymmetry_analysis_final.ipynb_ contains all the code used to generate the results in the manuscript.

The _raw_data_ folder contains all the neuronal connectivity data used generate various connectome networks.
The _input_files_ folder contains various lists of neurons and classes used in the code.
The _network_files_ folder contains symmetrized and desymmetrized version of networks generated in this study. The algorithms of symmetrization/desymmetrization are included in code.
